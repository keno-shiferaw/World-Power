### Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Power Generation

### Objective
Electricity is generated in power plants using a variety of energy sources. When fossil fuels are used, the process releases CO2, one of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming and climate change. This project examines the existence of a relationship between a nationâ€™s gross domestic product and its level of emission of greenhouse gas emissions, using data from 165 countries over the years 2000 to 2018.

### Data
The main dataset contains information about the different technologies used to generate electricity in 165 countries of the world along with emissions from the sector. To further corroborate the analysis, a second dataset showcasing the electrification rate of each country over the stated period is used. 

### Tools
For this project Python is used for analysis and Tableau for visualization.
